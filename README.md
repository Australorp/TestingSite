# TestingSite

This is an example site for testing and learning CSS, and maybe some JS in the future.

The site is currently using no screen width media queries. It instead uses vw as a prominent unit, so it should resize responsively and keep the same look for all devices. There are probably big downsides to this method, but I wanted to see how feasible a site with no media queries would be.
